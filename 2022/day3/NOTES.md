# Day 3

When I saw the part about a common character, I immediately though HASHMAPS - I think that is the fastest way to find it. In part 2 it was simply iterating over the lines in steps of 3.

For the priority, I also remembered ASCII codes - much easier than making a lookup table.

Takes around 5ms
